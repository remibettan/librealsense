E2E: pytest-check soft checks under reruns.

pytest-check defers failures to makereport. The conftest pytest_runtest_call bridge raises
them in the call phase instead, so they are attributed to the call (not teardown), visible to
the rerun decision, and logged into the per-test .log file on every attempt. These tests lock
in that behavior.
